# Preparing SD Card image for GS from prebuilt image

* Download prebuilt image from release https://github.com/RomanLut/hx-esp32-cam-fpv/releases

* Write image to SD Card using Raspberry Pi Imager https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
 
   *Choose "Custom OS"...*
* Let it boot once into GS software or user prompt.
  
   *Sometimes it can boot into user prompt on very first boot because wlan0 and wlan1 get allocated in incorrect order. If it happends - just reboot, it should correctly boot into GS software.*

Based on my analysis of the code, I can now explain the mechanisms used by different packets to avoid interfering with the camera and why the DHT11 transmission was causing JPEG corruption.

## Analysis of Packet Transmission Mechanisms

### 1. Video Packets (Air2Ground_Video_Packet)
- **Transmission mechanism**: Sent directly from the camera data callback (`camera_data_available`)
- **Timing**: Real-time as camera frames are captured
- **Priority**: Highest priority, as they're critical for the FPV experience
- **Synchronization**: No special synchronization needed as they're generated by the camera hardware

### 2. OSD Packets (Air2Ground_OSD_Packet)
- **Transmission mechanism**: Sent periodically (every 200ms) from the main loop
- **Synchronization**: Sent only when not actively capturing frames (`s_video_frame_started` is false)
- **Protection mechanism**: Uses `s_fec_encoder.lock()` and `s_fec_encoder.unlock()` to ensure thread safety

### 3. Config Packets (Air2Ground_Config_Packet)
- **Transmission mechanism**: Sent periodically (every 500ms) from the main loop
- **Synchronization**: Sent only when not actively capturing frames
- **Protection mechanism**: Uses `s_fec_encoder.lock()` and `s_fec_encoder.unlock()` to ensure thread safety

### 4. Report Packets (Air2Ground_Report_Packet) - DHT11 Data
- **Transmission mechanism**: Sent periodically (every 5 seconds) from the main loop
- **Synchronization**: Sent only when not actively capturing frames (`!s_video_frame_started`)
- **Protection mechanism**: Uses `s_fec_encoder.lock()` and `s_fec_encoder.unlock()` to ensure thread safety

## Why DHT11 Transmission Was Causing JPEG Corruption

The issue with the DHT11 transmission causing JPEG corruption was likely due to:

1. **Timing Conflicts**: The DHT11 sensor requires precise timing for communication, and if this communication happened during active camera frame processing, it could interrupt the camera data flow.

2. **I2C Bus Contention**: The I2C communication with the auxiliary unit for DHT11 data could interfere with other I2C devices or create timing issues during critical camera operations.

3. **CPU Resource Competition**: Reading the DHT11 sensor requires CPU cycles that could impact the real-time processing of camera data.

4. **Interrupt Handling**: The DHT11 sensor reading process might involve interrupt handling that could interfere with the camera's interrupt-driven data capture.

## How Other Packets Avoid Interference

### 1. Proper Synchronization
All non-video packets check the `s_video_frame_started` flag before transmission:
```cpp
if (!s_video_frame_started && s_initialized && s_connected_gs_device_id != 0) {
    s_fec_encoder.lock();
    // Send packet
    s_fec_encoder.unlock();
}
```

### 2. Periodic Transmission Outside Critical Windows
Non-video packets are sent periodically during "idle" periods when the camera is not actively capturing frames.

### 3. Thread Safety with Locks
The FEC encoder uses locks to ensure that only one packet type is being encoded and sent at a time.

### 4. Priority Management
The camera data callback has the highest priority, and other operations are designed to yield to it.

## The Solution Implemented

The solution implemented in the code addresses these issues by:

1. **Checking Camera Status**: Before sending DHT11 data, the system checks if the camera is actively capturing frames:
   ```cpp
   if (!s_video_frame_started && s_initialized && s_connected_gs_device_id != 0) {
       // Send report packet
   }
   ```

2. **Using Proper Synchronization**: The DHT11 task waits for camera operations to complete:
   ```cpp
   // Check if camera is busy, if so, wait until it's not
   int wait_count = 0;
   while (s_video_frame_started && wait_count < 20) { // Max 1 second wait
       vTaskDelay(50 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
       wait_count++;
   }
   ```

3. **Implementing Timeouts**: The I2C communication with the auxiliary unit includes timeouts to prevent blocking:
   ```cpp
   esp_err_t ret = i2c_master_cmd_begin(I2C_MASTER_NUM, cmd, pdMS_TO_TICKS(50));
   ```

4. **Lower Priority Task**: The DHT11 task is set to a lower priority to minimize interference:
   ```cpp
   vTaskPrioritySet(NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1);
   ```

This approach ensures that DHT11 data transmission only occurs during "safe" periods when the camera is not actively capturing and processing frames, preventing the JPEG corruption issues.

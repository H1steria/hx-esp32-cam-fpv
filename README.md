# Recommended hardware

Although the project can be compiled for various platforms, the recommended hardware for optimal performance is:
- **VTX:** **Seed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense** with **ov5640** camera, **M12** 120° lens, 2dBi dipole
![alt text](doc/images/xiaoesp32s3sense.jpg "xiaoesp32s3sense.jpg")

- **VRX:** **Radxa Zero 3W** with dual **rtl8812au** wifi cards, 4x5dBi dipoles
![alt text](doc/images/radxa3w_gs.jpg "radxa3w_gs.jpg")

# Theory

Wi-Fi bandwidth is insufficient for uncompressed video streaming, and the **ESP32** lacks the processing power for real-time video encoding. Fortunately, **OV2640/OV5640** camera modules can output frames as JPEG images. This project utilizes that feature to stream MJPEG video.

The camera continuously scans the image sensor and encodes the data row-by-row into JPEG format. These JPEG frames are transmitted to the **ESP32** over I2S at 10 MHz (or 20 MHz for **ESP32-S3** with OV5640), where they are optionally written to an SD card (if DVR mode is enabled), forward error correction (FEC) encoded, and streamed over Wi-Fi.

To reduce latency and memory usage, the esp32-camera component (https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera) was modified to stream data directly from DMA as it arrives, rather than waiting for full frames. This cuts latency by 10–20 ms and minimizes PSRAM usage. As the camera captures the image, data is already in transmission to the Ground Station (GS).

Wi-Fi packets are transmitted using packet injection, a feature supported by the **ESP32**. FEC (forward error correction)  ensures that the GS can recover from packet loss without needing acknowledgments or retransmissions.

The air unit can also record video directly to an SD card. To compensate for the inconsistent write speeds of SD cards, a 3 MB buffer is used. The recorded video is identical in quality to the streamed version.

JPEG image sizes vary depending on scene complexity. Adaptive JPEG compression dynamically adjusts the quality level to match the available bandwidth and maintain smooth streaming.

The Ground Station can be a **Radxa Zero 3W**, **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, up to Raspberry Pi 4**, equipped with Wi-Fi cards in monitor mode such as **Realtek 8812AU** (recommended) or **AR9271**. Dual Wi-Fi cards can be used for diversity reception.

**8812au** with a low-noise amplifier (LNA) is preferred; however, a high-power amplifier (PA) is not critical since the range is primarily limited by the **ESP32's** maximum transmit power of 100 mW (20 dBm).

JPEG decoding on the GS is handled by TurboJPEG, achieving decoding times between 1–7 ms depending on resolution. Frames are uploaded as textures and rendered to screen.

On-screen display (OSD) elements are drawn using OpenGL ES.

The link is bi-directional, allowing the Ground Station to send data back to the air unit. Currently, this is used for camera and Wi-Fi configuration, as well as bi-directional telemetry streaming (also FEC encoded).

Here’s an example video captured at 30 FPS, resolution **800×456**, using an **OV2640** sensor with a 120° M8 lens:

# Is it worth building?

**Set your expectations low**. This system begins with a very basic camera — the **OV5640** — comparable to smartphone cameras from around 2005. Using such a sensor means accepting several limitations:
- Noisy image
- Poor brightness/contrast handling, especially in backlit scenes
- Distorted and inaccurate colors
- Weak low-light performance
- Vignetting from cheap lenses
- Blurry corners due to poor focus
- High JPEG compression artifacts

In addition, the **ESP32** lacks hardware video encoding capabilities. As a result, the video stream is transmitted as a series of JPEG images — an inefficient method that wastes bandwidth and reduces potential image quality.

Given its low resolution, **esp32-cam-fpv** should be compared to cheap analog 5.8GHz AIO FPV cameras, not modern digital systems.

What you gain compared to analog AIO systems? For roughly the same price, **hx-esp32-cam-fpv** offers:
- Simultaneous video recording on both air unit and ground station
- Digital OSD
- Mavlink telemetry and RC control
- Telemetry logging
- Clean digital image with no analog interference

Key Drawbacks:
- Blocky JPEG compression
- No Wide Dynamic Range (WDR)
- Distorted color reproduction
- Poor low-light performance (especially with **OV2640**)
- Inconsistent quality between camera units
- Occasional frame drops

**hx-esp32-cam-fpv** is clearly outclassed by all commercial digital FPV systems in terms of image quality.

However, compared to other open-source digital FPV solutions like OpenHD, RubyFPV, or OpenIPC, it offers:
- low cost air unit
- Very compact size air unit (**XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense**)
- Low power usage (under 300mA at 5V)
- The same ground station hardware used for OpenHD/RubyFPV/OpenIPC can be reused — just swap the SD card.

# Building

> [!NOTE]
> Please use **release** branch (it contains lastest release). **master** branch can be unstable.

## Air Unit

## Air Unit Variant 1: ESP32CAM

Flashing esp32cam firmware: [/doc/flashing_esp32_cam.md](/doc/flashing_esp32_cam.md)

![alt text](doc/images/esp32cam_pinout.png "pinout")

The **esp32cam** doesn’t have many free pins. You can optionally solder a **REC button** and an additional **REC status LED** where the **Flash LED** normally is.

![alt text](doc/images/esp32cam_led.jpg "esp32cam_led.jpg")

Both internal red LED and additional LED are used for indication:
 * solid - not recording
 * blinking 1Hz - recording
 * blinking 3Hz - OTA update mode.
 
**REC button** is used to start/stop air unit recording. Hold **REC button** on powerup to enter OTA (over the air update) mode.

With pcb antenna, 50m transmission distance can barely be achieved. A jumper has to be soldered to use external antena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBTZuvg5sM8

## Air Unit Variant 2: **Seed Studio XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense** + OV2640 + M8 120° lens

Flashing **Seed Studio XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense** firmware: [/doc/flashing_esp32s3sense.md](/doc/flashing_esp32s3sense.md)

STL files for 3D Printing on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6624598

![alt text](doc/images/esp32s3sense_shell.jpg "esp32s3sense_shell") ![alt text](doc/images/esp32s3sense_shell1.jpg "esp32s3sense_shell1")

![alt text](doc/images/esp32s3sense_shell2.jpg "esp32s3sense_shell2") ![alt text](doc/images/esp32s3sense_shell3.jpg "esp32s3sense_shell3")

![alt text](doc/images/esp32s3sense_shell_plane.jpg "esp32s3sense_plane") ![alt text](doc/images/esp32s3sense_j3.jpg "esp32s3sense_j3")

Module comes with moderate flexible antenna which should be replaced with 2dBi dipole to maximize range.

Internal yellow LED conflicts with SD card and thus can not be used for indication. External LED should be soldered to pin **D0** via 150 ... 680 Ohm resistor.

Existing **Boot** button is used to start/stop air unit recording.

A jumper should be soldered on **J3** to enable SD card usage (somehow it works without it, but is required for stable operation).

## Air Unit Variant 3: **Seed Studio XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense** + OV5640 + M12 120° lens (recommended)

Flashing **Seed Studio XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense** firmware: [/doc/flashing_esp32s3sense.md](/doc/flashing_esp32s3sense.md)

![alt text](doc/images/shell_14.jpg "shell_14") ![alt text](doc/images/ov5640.jpg "ov5640")

**es32s3sense** boards are sold with **ov2640** camera which can be easily replaced with **ov5640** purchased separately. No hardware modifications are required for camera replacement.

**ov5640** camera on **esp32s3sense** offers 640x360 30/50fps, 640x480 30/40fps, 800x456 30/50fps, 1024x576 30fps and 1280x720 30fps modes, less noisy sensor, much better colors and contrast, better performance against sunlight.

Connection diagram is similar to **Variant 2**.

800x456 30fps MCS3 26Mbps (actual transfer rate ~10Mbps total with FEC 6/12), **esp32sesense + ov5640** camera 160° M8 lens:

# Displayport MSP OSD

Configure Displayport MSP OSD 115200, Avatar in INav/Betaflight/Ardupilot.

A number of OSD fonts are included. User fonts can be placed in ```/gs/assets/osd_fonts/``` - 24 pixels wide png format.
 
https://github.com/RomanLut/hx-esp32-cam-fpv/assets/11955117/42821eb8-5996-4f39-aac6-2929c9d3661e



# Bidirectional serial connection

There is bidirectional stream sent with FEC encoding (Ground2Air: ```k=2 n=3```, Air2Ground: Same as video stream, ```k=6 n=12``` by default).

It can be used for downlink telemetry (Mavlink 1, Mavlnk2, LTE) and RC (See below). 

Setup baudrate 115200 for the UARTs. 
 
 
## Mavlink 2 RC

The **hx-esp32-cam-fpv** system supports remote control via the **Mavlink 2** protocol. It accepts **Mavlink 2 RC command messages** (```MAXLINK_RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE```) over the VRX UART interface.

Although **Mavlink 1** and even **MSP RC** are also compatible, the system is specifically optimized for **Mavlink 2**. It accurately detects the boundaries of RC packets and transmits them without aggregation to minimize latency.

Example setup with https://github.com/RomanLut/hx_espnow_rc TX/RX modules:
![alt text](doc/images/mavlink2_rc.png "mavlink2_rc")


## MSP RC translation ( Mavlink2MspRC )

Some flight controllers have a limited number of available UART ports.  

To address this, you can enable a camera configuration option that translates **Mavlink 2 RC commands** (```MAXLINK_RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE```) into **MSP RC commands** (```MSP_SET_RAW_RC```). These translated commands are then sent over the **DisplayPort OSD UART**, allowing full aircraft control without requiring a Mavlink UART connection to the flight controller ( it is supported by inav firmware ).

*Note: Translating MSP telemetry to Mavlink telemetry is currently not implemented*.

## Disabling camera from RC Controller

If **Mavlink RC** is used, it is possible to disable camera using channel configured in ```Camera Stop Channel``` camera configuraion. 



# Camera OSD Elements

![alt text](doc/images/osd_elements.png "osd_elements")

From left to right:
 - ```AIR:-10``` Air Unit RSSI in Dbm
 - ```GS:-14:-13``` GS RSSI in Dbm on each wifi card
 - Average wifi queue usage. Should be below 50%. Look for free wifi channel if it turns red frequently
 - actual MJPEG stream bandwidth in Mbps (without FEC encoding). Wifi stream bandwwith = MJPEG stream bandwidth * FEC_n / FEC_k (2x for FEC 6/12)
 - resolution
 - FPS at GS
 - ```!NO PING!``` Indicates that air unit does not receive GS packets (configuration packets, uplink Mavlink)
 - ```AIR``` Air unit is recording video to SD card
 - ```GS``` GS is recording video to SD card
 - ```HQ DVR``` HQ DVR mode enabled
 - ```!SD SLOW!``` SD card on AIR unit is too slow to record video, frames are skipped
 - ```OFF``` Camera is stopped by RC cahnnel
 - ```Air: 112°``` Air unit temperature exceeded 110° (overheat)
 - ```GS: 90°``` GS CPU temperature exceeded 80° (overheat). Throttling and degraded performance may occur.

# Considerations

## Resolution

**OV2640**

**esp32cam** and **esp32s3sence** boards come with the **OV2640** sensor by default. 

The sweet spot settings for this camera seems to be 800x600 resolution with JPEG compression level in range 8…63 (lower is better quality). 30 fps is achieved. Additionaly, custom 16:9 modes 640x360 and 800x456 are implemented. Personally I like 800x456 because 16:9 looks more "digital" :)

Another options are 640x480 and 640x360, which can have better JPEG compression level set per frame, but luck pixel details and thus do not benefit over 800x456.

Any resolution lower then 640x360, despite high frame rate (60fps can be achieved at 320x240), is useless in my opinion due to luck of details.

**ov2640** can capture 1280x720 at 13 FPS. Image looks Ok on 7" screen, but FPS is definitely lower then acceptable level for FPV glasses.

It is possible to overclock **ov2640** sensor in **Camera Settings** to enable 40Fps in 640x360, 640x480 and 800x456 modes, however it is not garantied to work. If it does not work - try with another sensor.

**ov2640** is Ok for day but has much worse light sensitivity and dynamic range compared to **ov5640** in the evening. This and the next video are made in almost the same light conditions:

800x456 30fps MCS3 26Mbps (actual transfer rate ~10Mbps totalwith FEC 6/12) with ov2640 camera 120° M8 lens:

https://github.com/RomanLut/hx-esp32-cam-fpv/assets/11955117/9e3b3920-04c3-46fd-9e62-9f3c5c584a0d

**OV5640**

**OV5640** supports the same resolutions and offers the same FPS thanks to binning support, but also have much better light sensivity, brightness and contrast. It also has higher pixel rate and supports 1280x720 30fps (which can be received by **esp32s3** thanks to 2x maximum DMA speed).

800x456 image looks much better on **ov5640** compared to **ov2640** thanks to highger sensor quality.

It is possible to enable **50FPS** 640x360 and 800x456 modes is **Camera Settings**. Unfortunatelly, camera seems to distort colors in low light conditions in these modes (flying in the evening).

While **ov5640** can do **50FPS** in higher resolution modes, it does not make a sense to use them because higher FPS requires too high bandwidth for MJPEG stream. 

**Note: ov5640** does not support **vertical image flip**.

800x456 30fps MCS3 26Mbps (~10Mbps actual transfer rate total with FEC 6/12) with ov5640 camera 160° M8 lens:

## HQ DVR Mode

While **ov5640** can capture 1280x720 30fps,  this mode requires too high bandwidth, so system has to set high compression levels which elliminate detais. There is no sense to use this mode for FPV.

Since release 0.2.1, 1280x720 mode works in "HQ DVR" mode: video is saved with best possible quality limited by SD card performance only on Air unit, while frames are sent as fast as link allows (usually 5-10 FPS).

Mode is usefull for recording video which can be watched on big screen.

An example of DVR recording:

## Lens 

![alt text](doc/images/lens.jpg "lens")

Always choose lenses with a larger diameter. Larger lenses offer better light sensitivity, reduced distortion, and improved optical resolution.

Both the **ESP32-CAM** and **ESP32-S3 Sense** come with narrow-angle lenses, which should be replaced with wide-angle lenses (120° or 160°) for UAV use.

A M12 120° wide-angle lens is recommended. The M8 wide-angle lenses on these modules are of poor quality, exhibiting high distortion, poor focus, chromatic aberration, and low light sensitivity.

Be aware that some sensors have slightly different lens mount diameters. For example, the leftmost sensor is not compatible with the next two. I would recommend buying sensor with lens preinstalled rather replacing lens.

Also note: so called "night version" sensor lacks an IR filter and will display distorted colors in sunlight (buy correct lens with IR filter!).

# Wifi channel

Default wifi channel is set to 7. 3…7 seems to be the best setting, because antennas are tuned for the middle range. F.e. in my experiments, channel 11 barely works with **AR9271** and **esp32s3sense** stock antenna. In the crowded wifi environment, best channel is the one not used by other devices. System may not be able to push frames on busy channel at all (high wifi queue usage will be shown on OSD).

## Wifi rate

24Mbps or MCS3 26Mbps seems to be the sweet spot which provides high bandwidth and range. 24 is Wifi rate; actual bandwith is ~8-14Mbps total ( including FEC 6/12). Full 24Mbps transfer rate is not achievable.

Lowering bandwidth to 12Mbps seems to not provide any range improvement; reception still drops at -83dB. 

Increasing bandwidth to 36Mbps allows to send less compressed frames, but decreases range to 600m. 36Mbps bandwidth is not fully used because practical maximum **ESP32** bandwidth seems to be 2.3Mb/sec (23Mbps) in ideal conditions ( 29Mbps or 2.9Mb/sec for **ESP32s**). On the field, practical transfer rate is ~14Mbps max.

When Air Recording is enabled, rate is also limited by SD write speed 0.8Mb/sec (8Mbps without FEC) for **ESP32** and 1.8Mb/sec (18Mbps without FEC) for **ESP32s3**. 

## Wifi interferrence 

Wifi channel is shared between multiple clients. In crowded area, bandwith can be significanly lower then expected. While tested on table at home, **hx-esp32-cam-fpv** can show ~5FPS due to low bandwidth and high packet loss; this is normal.

Note than UAV in the air will sense carrier of all Wifi routers around and share wifi channel bandwidth with them (See [Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma/) )

## DVR

Class 10 SD Card is required for the air unit. Maximum supported size is 32MB. Should be formatted to FAT32. The quality of recording is the same on air and ground; no recompression is done (obviously, GS recording does not contain lost frames).

**ESP32** can work with SD card in 4bit and 1bit mode. 1bit mode is chosen to free few pins. 4bit mode seems to provide little benefit (write speed is only 30% faster in 4 bit mode).

## Adaptive compression

With the same JPEG compression level the size of a frame can vary a lot depending on scenery. A lot means order of 5 or more. Adaptive compression is implemented to achieve best possible image quality.

For **ov2640** sensor, compression level can be set in range 1..63 (lower is better quality). However **ov2640** can return broken frames or crash with compression levels lower then 8. Also, decreasing compression level below 8 increases frame size but does not increase image quality much due to bad sensor quality itself. System uses range 8...63.

Frame data flows throught a number of queues, which can easily be overloaded due to small RAM size on ESP32, see [profiling](https://github.com/RomanLut/hx-esp32-cam-fpv/blob/master/doc/development.md#profiling).

Air unit calculates 3 coefficients which are used to adjust compression quality, where 8 is minumum compression level and each coefficient can increase it up to 63.

Theoretical maximum bandwidth of current Wifi rate is multipled by 0.5 (50%), divided by FEC redundancy **(FEC_n / FEC_k)** and divided by FPS. The result is target frame size.

Additionally, compression level is limited by maximum SD write speed when air unit DVR is enabled; it is 0.8Mb/sec **ESP32** and 1.8Mb/sec for **esp32s3sense**.  **ESP32** can write at 1.9Mb/sec but can not keep up such speed due to high overall system load.

Additionally, frame size is decreased if Wifi output queue grows (Wifi channel is shared between multiple devices. Practical bandwidth can be much lower then expected). **This is the most limiting factor**.

Adaptive compression level is a key component of **hx-esp32-cam-fpv**. Without adaptive compression, compression level have to be set to so low quality, that system became unusable.

# FEC

Frames are sent using **Forward Error Correction Encoding**. Currently FEC is set to k=6, n=12 which means that bandwidth is doubled, but any 6 of 12 packets in block can be lost, and frame will still be recovered. It can be changed to 6/8 or 6/10 in OSD menu.

If single packet is lost and can not be recovered by FEC, the whole frame is lost. FEC is set to such high redundancy because lost frame at 30 fps looks very bad, even worse then overal image quality decrease caused by wasted bandwidth.

# Known Wifi cards

**RTL8812AU-based** cards are recommended for the project.

*High power output on the ground station (GS) is not critical for the esp32cam-fpv project, as the range is primarily limited by the ESP32's maximum output of 20 dBm. Additionally, to the best of my knowledge, there are very few RTL8812AU-based cards on the market with a power amplifier (PA) on the 2.4 GHz band. Most RTL8812AU cards advertised as "high output power" include a PA only on the 5 GHz band. On 2.4 GHz, the output is limited to the bare RTL8812AU chip, which typically delivers around 16–17 dBm at lower data rates.*

**AR9271** should also work but not tested. **RTL8812AU** has antena diversity and thus is recommended over **AR9271**.

Popular **RTL8812EU** can not be used because it does not support 2.4Ghz.

### Noname RTL8812AU

Card can be powered from 5V and comes with good 5dBi dualband antenas.

Equipped with two SKY85601 amplifiers. 5GHz: 12dB LNA, no PA. 2.4GHz: No LNA and PA. Theoretical output power: 5Ghz: 11-13 dBm, 2.4Ghz: 16-17 dBm.

My experience with this card is negative. Card is **NOT recommended** due to low output power. As 2.4Ghz power output is limited by RTL8812AU chip iself, maybe I have broken card?

![alt text](doc/images/rtl8812au.jpg "rtl8812au")


### Comfast RTL8812AU

Equipped with two SKY85703 amplifiers. 5GHz: 12dB LNA, 17dBm output PA. 2.24Ghz: No LNA and PA. Theoretical output power: 5Ghz: 17 dBm, 2.4Ghz: 16-17 dBm.

Recommended. You will have to solder IPX antena connectors. Adding metal cover is also recommended.

![alt text](doc/images/comfast.jpg "comfast rtl8812au")


## Antenas

This 2.4Ghz antena seems to be the best choice for the UAV because it is flexible and can be mouted on the wing using part of cable tie or toothpick:

![alt text](doc/images/2dbi_dipole.jpg "2dbi dipole")

Various PCB antenas for 2.4Ghz can be considered (not tested):

![alt text](doc/images/pcb_antena.jpg "pcb antena")

The best choice for GS is 4x5dBi dipoles or 2x5dbi dipoles + 2xBetaFPV Moxon Antenna.

It is important that all antenas should be mounded **VERTICALLY**.

**esp32cam** PCB antena can not provide range more then a few metters. 

Note: **esp32cam** board requires soldering resistor to use external antena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBTZuvg5sM8

Do not power wifi card or **ESP32** without antena attached; it can damage output amplifier.

# Dual Wifi Adapters (recommended)

**hx-esp32-cam-fpv** supports dual Wifi adapters to decrease packet loss ratio. [Default launch script](https://github.com/RomanLut/hx-esp32-cam-fpv/blob/1e14550fcf04f8fcb10a3b6a18126332e7aa6609/gs/launch.sh#L20) will launch GS in dual adapters mode if **wlan1** and **wlan2** are found in the system.

## Range 

**2dbi dipole on plane, 5dbi dipoles on GS:** 1.2km at 24Mbps, 600m at 36Mbps (line of sight, away from wifi routers). Range is decreased significantly with walls/trees on the way.

**2dbi dipole on plane, 5dbi dipole + BetaFPV Moxon Antenna on GS:** 2km at 24Mbps, 900m at 36Mbps.

Range is limited by **ESP32** output power (100mW 20dB) and highly depends on antena type and quality.

# Drivers 

I am still searching for the best **RTL8812au** drivers for this project.

There are seems to be few choises:

  * Works fine on RPI0 2W, does not work on RPI4: https://github.com/morrownr/8812au-20210820  (https://github.com/morrownr/8812au)
  * Seems to work but does not report RSSI: https://github.com/svpcom/rtl8812au/tree/v5.2.20
  * Seems to work but RSSI seems to be reported 2x higher then real sometimes: https://github.com/svpcom/rtl8812au/tree/v5.2.20-rssi-fix-but-sometimes-crash
  * Does not work: https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au

Proper drivers for **AR8271** are included in OS image already.

Note that some optimizations important for other open source digital FPV systems are not important for **hx-esp32-cam-fpv**. Wifi card is not used on air unit, so high output power and and high-bandwidth packet injection are not important.

## Latency

Latency ranges between 90–110 ms across all resolutions at both 30 and 50 fps. Technologically, the system is similar to HDZero in that it begins transmission without waiting for a full frame from the camera. However, the source of the current latency still needs to be investigated, as the expected range should be around 40–80 ms.

# Unsuccessfull attempts

## Attempt to use internal Rapsberry Pi Wifi card in monitor mode

![alt text](doc/images/gs_internal_wifi.jpg "gs internal wifi")

**NEXMON** drivers https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon offer monitor mode and packet injection for internal wifi card of Raspberry Pi. Original idea was to build extremely cheap ground station based on Raspberry Pi with internal antena replaced by dipole.

Unfortunatelly these attempts were unsuccessfull.

**NEXMON** drivers do support monitor mode and are used in Kali Linux builds for Rapsberry Pi. Unfortunatelly, to many packets are missed while listening for high-bandwidth stream. Packet injection barely works; few packets can be sent which  might be enough for wifi deauth, but not for sending data stream. Attempts to use packet injection crash the driver. Attempts to send packets lead to lossing 70% of incoming packets. Packet injection is disabled in the last builds of Kali Linux.

Even with external 2dBi dipole soldered properly, sensitivity is very bad. RSSI shows values 20dB less compared to rtl8812au card. In experimental single directional fpv system I was able to achieve ~20m transmission distance.

Additionally, there is a bug in the driver: if wifi hotspot which was associated last time is not available on boot, driver crashes on boot and wifi adapter is not available (a surpise on the field!).

Lesons learned: 

  - a wifi card with a good sensitivity and proper drivers with monitor mode and packet injection support is a key factor for successfull open source digital FPV system. So far only rtl8812au matches these criterias and is recommended choice.
  
  - you should aim for the best reception sensitivity possible on ground; GS should not be cheap. Air unit should be cheap - it can crash or fly away; GS is not.


## Using sensors with long flex cables

![alt text](doc/images/long_flex_cable.jpg "long flex cable")

**esp32cam** can not rotate image and thus should be mounted vertically (vertical image flip is possible). Such form factor is not the best for a small plane.

Sensors can be bought with flex cables of various length.

Unfortunatelly attempt to use sensor with long flex cable was unsuccessfull. Flex cable wires cary high frequency (10Mhz) digital signals which produce a lot of RF noise. GPS sensor mounted in less then 7cm from **esp32cam** was jammed completely. Micro plane does not have a lot of space to separate GPS sensor from **esp32cam**. Even moved to the end of the wing (15cm away from **esp32cam**) it still barely found any satellites. **esp32cam** and flex cable shielding improved situation a little bit, but not enough to trust GPS sensor and try a range testing. 

**esp32cam** with long flex cable has been replaced with compact **esp32s3sense** board.

# Development

See [development.md](https://github.com/RomanLut/hx-esp32-cam-fpv/blob/master/doc/development.md)

# Original project

**esp32-cam-fpv** project was originally developed by **jeanlemotan** https://github.com/jeanlemotan/esp32-cam-fpv (currently seems to be abandoned). Some more work has been done by **Ncerzzk** https://github.com/Ncerzzk/esp-vtx who also seems to developed custom air unit hardware https://github.com/Ncerzzk/esp-vtx-hardware and continues to work on gs https://github.com/Ncerzzk/esp-vtx-gs-rs. 

The goal of this fork is to develop fpv system for small inav-based plane, starting from the prof-of-concept code of **jeanlemotan**.

# FAQ

* Can  use Runcam VRX with tis project?
  No, Runcam VRX contains two **RLT8812EU** cards which support 5.8Ghz only.

* Can original **Raspberry Pi Zero W** be used as GS?
  
  No, RPI0W does not have enough performance to decode 800x600 MJPEG stream with it's CPU.

* Do I need to pair Air unit and GS?

  No, the ground station (GS) will automatically connect to any unpaired air unit detected on the selected Wi-Fi channel. Once connected, the air unit will communicate exclusively with that GS until it is rebooted. While multiple air unit/GS pairs can technically operate on the same channel, this is not recommended.

* What if packet lost and FEC can not recover?

  Then the whole frame is lost. That's why FEC is set to high redundancy by default.
